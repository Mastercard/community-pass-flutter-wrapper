### saveBiometricConsent

This API is used to save the user consent prior to collecting the biometric(s) and generating a unique digital identity.

### getRegisterUserWithBiometrics

This API is used by the Reliant Application to receive a bio-token and an R-ID following the registration of a new user.

### getRegisterBasicUser

This API is used to initiate the user registration with a passcode. The API is initiated by the Reliant Application after verifying that the user is unique and is invoked when the user declines the biometric consent capture.

### getWriteProfile

This API is used for card issuance to write the userâ€™s basic profile data to the card once the user has been successfully registered, either by biometric flow or passcode flow. This operation is initiated by the Reliant Application after a successful user registration, when the Reliant Application receives the R-ID.

### getWritePasscode

This API is used to write the Passcode to the card. It is initiated by the Reliant Application to CPK after a successful user registration. The received Intent must be used for starting the Activity using startActivityForResult(), and the result must be handled via the onActivityResult() method.
